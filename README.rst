You will receive a string as input, potentially a mixture of upper and lower case, numbers, special characters etc. The task is to determine if the string contains at least one of each letter of the alphabet. Return true if all are found and false if not. Write it as a RESTful web service (no authentication necessary) in any language/framework you choose and document the service.
